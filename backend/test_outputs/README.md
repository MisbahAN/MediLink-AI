# Test Outputs

This directory contains outputs and artifacts generated during testing.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `performance_reports/`
Contains JSON reports generated by the performance testing suite:
- **Detailed metrics**: Processing times, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **Test summaries**: Success rates, error analysis, benchmarks
- **Bottleneck analysis**: Identification of performance issues
- **Concurrency results**: Throughput and concurrent request handling
- **Memory leak analysis**: Growth patterns and leak detection

## 🔄 File Management

- Reports are automatically generated with timestamps
- Files are organized by test type and execution time
- Old reports are preserved for historical comparison
- No sensitive data is stored in these reports

## 📊 Report Format

Each JSON report contains:
```json
{
  "test_summary": { "total_tests": N, "success_rate": X },
  "performance_metrics": { "avg_processing_time": X, "memory_usage": Y },
  "detailed_results": [...],
  "concurrency_analysis": {...},
  "memory_leak_analysis": {...},
  "expected_bottlenecks": {...}
}
```

These outputs help track performance trends and validate system capabilities over time.
