  "expected_bottlenecks": {
    "OCR_API_Latency": "External API calls to Mistral and Gemini services are likely the primary bottleneck. Each page requires OCR processing which involves network round-trip times and AI model inference. Large documents (15+ pages) will experience cumulative latency.",
    "PDF_Processing": "PDF parsing and image extraction for large files can be CPU-intensive. Documents with many images or complex layouts will require more processing time.",
    "Memory_Usage": "Processing multiple large PDF files simultaneously will consume significant memory. Each document's content is held in memory during processing, and image extraction can create additional memory pressure.",
    "Field_Mapping_Complexity": "OpenAI API calls for field mapping become more expensive with complex documents. The mapping process involves analyzing extracted text against form field requirements.",
    "Sequential_Processing": "Current architecture processes documents sequentially rather than in parallel, which limits throughput for concurrent requests.",
    "File_IO_Operations": "Temporary file creation, PDF reading/writing, and storage operations can become bottlenecks with high concurrent load or very large files.",
    "Redis_Caching": "If Redis is not available or slow, caching operations will fall back to in-memory storage, potentially impacting performance and memory usage."
