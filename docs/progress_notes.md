## Session Log

### June 11, 6PM - Day 1: Backend Core Setup
**Time**: 5:30PM - 6:00PM  
**Focus**: Project structure and FastAPI foundation

#### Completed Files:
- [x] Project structure â€” organized backend, frontend, docs folders with proper __init__.py files
- [x] requirements.txt â€” FastAPI dependencies with AI services (fixed version conflicts)
- [x] .env.example â€” environment variables template created
- [x] .gitignore â€” comprehensive ignore file for Python + Next.js
- [x] Virtual environment â€” created and dependencies installed successfully

#### Key Decisions:
- Used flexible version constraints (>=) in requirements.txt to resolve dependency conflicts
- Updated mistralai from 0.0.1 to 1.8.2 for compatibility
- Moved all documentation to docs/ folder for better organization
- Test files moved to backend/tests/test_data/ structure

#### Blockers/Issues:
- Initial mistralai version conflict resolved by updating to latest compatible version
- Had to use `python3` instead of `python` command on macOS

#### Next Session Goals:
- Complete FastAPI main.py and configuration files
- Implement file upload endpoint with validation
- Set up core schema models and dependencies
