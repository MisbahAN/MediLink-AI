Confirms predominant symptoms since April of numbness in his right hand and urinary hesitancy urgency. Additionally reporting right eye pain since time of clinic visit this morning. MRI brain and spine obtained following clinic visit and multiple lesions noted on brain and spine suggestive of pediatric MS. Presents for admission for IVMP.**Per clinic visit earlier today with Dr. Gu and confirmed with family at bedside:**Shakh is a 23 years old male, previously healthy who has been referred to neuroimmunology clinic for diagnosis of optic neuritis and abnormal brain MRI concerning for MS. He is referred by Dr Fazal-pediatric neurology in East Bay.He is here with dad; patient himself is an excellent historian and provided the following information- I do not have CSF results nor clinic note- I do have MRI report from Jan 21 2024 (no actual images)- with father and his permission, I reached out to Dr Shane- Dr Fazal's colleague on service who can help assist with quick access to Shakh's chart.Today, Shakh tells me that around early Oct 2023- he started to notice in right eye "neon bright color" fuzzy vision, and eye pain with movement and perhaps right side of his face in discomfort triggered by physical activities. Symptoms improved once he rested. By end of Oct 2023, he brought this up to parents and was brought to local eye doctor and recalled being told that "right eye being inflamed" and he recalled visual field deficits appreciated during exam.He was referred to UT ophthalmology Dr Derrek in Jan this year, per report negative MOG and AQP4 [While waiting on this appt, he thought some improvement but not back to baseline entirely - "not completely normal"].When he saw UT ophthalmology clinic, recommended brain and orbit and noted WM changes and MS was mentioned. He was treated with 5 days of IVMP and referred to see Dr Kosentka ped neurology.MRI report from Jan 21 2024- "Diffuse T2 hyperintensity and decreased volume throughout the right optic nerve is similar to prior examination however associated abnormal enhancement seen on prior study has resolved, presumably secondary to interveal treatment.Left optic nerve is subtle but diffusely small in caliber without significant change from last exam. Several intracranial WM lesions, stable from last"He saw Dr Fazal in Feb 2024-who obtained LP and had markers of MS and referred to MS clinic today. Below are information provided by Dr Shane.
