Discussion - in person History of Present Illness History of Present Illness 4 12 2023: Symptoms worsened with increasing abdominal pain and multiple mouth sores. He visited clinics in Arlington and subsequently Fairfax. A CT scan revealed right-sided colitis, consistent with previous findings. Markedly elevated ESR was noted at Inova. Recently discharged on a regimen of budesonide and antibiotics. 3 8 2023: He was started on Stelara, resulting in significant improvement in abdominal pain and reduced stool frequency. However, he continues to experience bothersome anal skin tags and recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes, confirmed by lab tests. Mouth ulcers have become less severe but remain present. Diarrhea has decreased. Valacyclovir has provided partial relief for the herpes outbreak but has not fully resolved it. Additionally, he reported swelling and discomfort in the right index finger. 12 4 2022: This 37-year-old male presented seeking a second opinion regarding rectal bleeding and anal issues. His symptoms began three years ago following a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. Since then, he has experienced frequent bloody stools, severe perianal pain, and external protrusions. He also reports recurrent painful mouth ulcers. Previous evaluations indicated anal disease consistent with Crohn's and mild inflammatory changes in the sigmoid and descending colon. No deep ulcers or skip lesions were noted. Pathology showed mild focally active colitis. Serologic testing revealed elevated ASCA (145), ACCA (102), and ALCA (76), supporting a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. CRP was mildly elevated at 1.6. Prior trials with mesalamine and oral corticosteroids offered minimal benefit. Following negative QuantiFERON testing, he underwent induction therapy. 10 15 2022: Initial onset of worsening abdominal pain and rectal bleeding exacerbated by dietary triggers. Evaluation noted anal fissures and skin tags with mild tenderness. A trial of topical steroids and dietary adjustments was initiated, with partial symptomatic relief but no significant change in stool frequency or bleeding.

He has been very frustrated with previous caregivers and seeks another opinion now. He denies joint pains or ophthalmologic problems. He denies other medical problems. A verbal consent was obtained by patient to perform telemedicine. Telemedicine platform used with patient: telephone. Patient located in the state of Virginia at home. Confirmed providers license is within the state documented by patient. [x] Yes [ ] No. ## Vital Signs - **Ht:** 73 in - **Wt:** 190 lbs - **Temp:** 97.7 F - **BMI:** 25.06 Index - **WC:** -8 lbs - **BSA:** 2.1 - **Wt-kg:** 86.18 kg ## Examination ### General Examination **GENERAL Appearance:** awake, alert, in no acute distress, did not appear uncomfortable. **PSYCH:** mood was euthymic. **HEAD:** normal. **LUNGS:** normal respiration, rhythm, and depth, normal and symetric excursion. **Neurologic:** alert and oriented to time, place, and person. ## Assessments 1. Crohn's disease of colon with rectal bleeding - K50.111 Very problematic case, apparently a poor response to Rinvoq. Reasonable to try Skyrizi if we can get him approved for that. ## Treatment 1. **Crohn's disease of colon with rectal bleeding** Refill prednisone Tablet, 20 MG, 1 tablet, Orally, twice a day, 7 days, 14 Tablet, Refills 0 **Notes:** Reasonable to continue steroid for now. Finish the antibiotics as well. I am concerned that he may reach a point where surgery is the only option and given the severe anal disease, AP resection would likely be necessary as part of that. ## 2. Others ### Notes: This patient encounter is appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances given the patient's particular presentation at this time. The patient has been advised of the potential risks and limitations of this mode of treatment (including, but not limited to, the absence of in-person examination) and has agreed to be treated in a remote fashion in spite of them. Any and all of the patient's patient's family's questions on this issue have been answered, and I have made no promises or guarantees to the
