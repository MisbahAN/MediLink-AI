Angela Nicole, NP **Progress Notes** Amy Rains, NP (Nurse Practitioner) â€¢ Neurology **Subjective:** **Patient ID:** Amy Chen is a 39 y.o. female. **INTERVAL HISTORY** Patient was last seen 2 24 2023 via telemedicine with Dr. Fazal at which time she was to continue Zomig PRN and Nurtec every other day. She is here today to restart Botox for prevention. Today she reports she had been off Aimovig since December. She had some improvement with Botox cosmetic. The last few months have been difficult: back to chronic daily HA. Nurtec: every other day (preventive) Zomig: stopped keeping track: increased frequency severity Vyepti: she would like to do this vs. Botox She continues klonopin for sleep. **INITIAL HPI** The patient has a longstanding history of migraine headaches. Under my care in the general neurology clinic, she has been managing chronic migraines, experiencing more than 15 headache days per month prior to initiating Botox therapy. Her headaches are predominantly unilateral, typically occurring on the left side, and are sometimes accompanied by a burning sensation in the face. She also experiences intermittent nausea, along with sensitivity to light, sound, and occasionally certain smells. Her medical history includes a brain MRI from 2010, which was reportedly normal. A follow-up brain MRI conducted in early 2017 revealed mild white matter changes consistent with migraine. She is tried multiple medications as outlined below: - Propranolol - Verapamil - Topiramate (Topamax) - Nortriptyline - Venlafaxine (Effexor) - Gabapentin Printed by Victoria Benn, MAC at 5 9 2023 11:57 AM Page 2 of 7
